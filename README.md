# Master Thesis

_This github repo contains the source code to my master thesis: A real-world pallet loading problem - developing a MIP formulation with practical constraints. The pallet loading problem (PLP) to a norwegian robot company has been solved using mixed-integer programming (MIP)._

## Code
The code is, for the most part, MIP constraints and variables that have been used to formulate different practical constraints to the PLP. In addition, multiple experiments have been created that can be run. 

## Software used
Julia 1.6.3 \n
Gurobi 9.14

## How to run? 
1. Install the project as a julia package
2. Run in terminal: julia --project src/Master.jl
3. Results are placed in "src/results"

## Documentation
The master thesis can be found under "Documentation" in the file hierarchy
